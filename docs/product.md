# Inkwise Product Overview

## What It Is

Inkwise is a structured writing tool that helps you transform rough ideas into polished, platform-ready drafts. It's designed for people who know what they want to say but struggle to say it clearly.

## Who It's For

- **Content creators** writing LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, blog articles
- **Business professionals** drafting memos, emails, and stakeholder updates
- **Anyone** who needs to communicate complex ideas simply

## The Core Loop

```
1. INTENT    → What are you trying to say? (1-2 sentences)
2. STRUCTURE → Break it into ordered claims (3-5 points)
3. EXPRESSION → Write each claim as a paragraph
4. DRAFT     → Format for your platform and export
```

### Phase 1: Intent
Define your core message before worrying about format. This prevents the blank page problem by giving you a north star.

### Phase 2: Structure
Turn your intent into discrete claims. Each claim should be a single, defensible point. Order them for narrative flow.

### Phase 3: Expression
Expand each claim into a full paragraph. The structure keeps you focused; you're not inventing—you're explaining.

### Phase 4: Draft
Choose your output format (LinkedIn, Email, Memo, etc.). The tool adapts your content to platform conventions and character limits.

## What "Done" Looks Like

A successful session ends with:
- A **clear hook** that captures attention
- **3-5 claims** that build your argument
- **Polished paragraphs** that explain each claim
- A **platform-ready draft** you can copy and post
