# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Inkwise is a local-first application that prioritizes your privacy. We believe your writing and ideas belong to you, not to a third-party server.

## Data Collection

**We collect no data.** Specifically:

- **No analytics tracking** — We don't use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or any tracking scripts
- **No cookies** — We don't set any cookies
- **No telemetry** — We don't phone home or send usage data
- **No user accounts** — There's no sign-up, login, or user identification
- **No server-side storage** — We don't operate any backend servers that store your data

## Data Storage

All your data is stored **locally in your browser** using `localStorage`:

- Your writing projects stay on your device
- Data persists between sessions in the same browser
- Clearing your browser data will delete your Inkwise projects
- Data is not synced across devices or browsers

### Storage Key

Your data is stored under the key `inkwise:v1` in localStorage. You can inspect this directly in your browser's Developer Tools.

## Data Export

You can export your data at any time:

- **JSON export** — Full project state for backup or transfer
- **Markdown export** — Human-readable format
- **Text export** — Plain text version

We recommend regular exports as your only backup mechanism.

## Third-Party Services

Inkwise makes **zero external network requests** during normal operation. The only network activity is:

- Initial page load (HTML, CSS, JS assets)
- Loading the demo project fixture (`/fixtures/demo-project.json`) if you click "Load Demo"

## Children's Privacy

Inkwise does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. Since Inkwise collects no data, changes would only reflect new features or clarifications.

**Summary:** Your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your information.
