      "demo-claim-2": "Separating intent from structure from expression gives each phase room to breathe. You can't edit what you haven't written—but you also can't write clearly without knowing what you're trying to say. A phased approach prevents premature optimization.",
      "demo-claim-3": "The bottleneck was never typing speed. It's knowing what to say next. When you start with a clear intent and ordered claims, the paragraphs almost write themselves. Structure unlocks flow."
