# Inkwise — LinkedIn Draft Builder (Intent → Structure → Expression → Draft)

A lightweight, offline-first writing tool that turns rough ideas into LinkedIn-ready drafts using a clear, repeatable workflow.

## Why it exists
Most writing tools either:
- start blank (high friction), or
- depend entirely on AI (low control).

Inkwise is the middle path: **a structured workflow** that helps you think clearly, write faster, and ship consistently — with **no account required** and **local persistence**.

## What it does
### Workflow
1. **Intent** — what you’re trying to say (1–2 sentences)
2. **Structure** — key claims / points you want to make
3. **Expression** — tighten language and phrasing
4. **Draft** — generate a LinkedIn-formatted post you can copy/export

### Features
- Offline-first: saves sessions via `localStorage`
- Copy/export flows for quick posting
- Draft presets (hooks + formats)
- Counters: LinkedIn character count, word count, estimated reading time
- Clean formatting helpers for consistent spacing

## 60-second walkthrough
1. Type your intent (1–2 sentences)
